# Arvados Systemd Scripts
These Systemd scripts are created for [Arvados](https://github.com/curoverse/arvados), an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data.
The default daemon hypervisor mentioned in [installation document](http://doc.arvados.org/install/index.html) of Arvados is runit. I provided these scripts to replace it on newer Linux redistributions (Debian Jessie, CentOS 7, etc.) who has deployed Systemd as its default bootstrap process.

### Usage
The scripts should be copied directly to its corresponding place.

#### ```system``` directory
